## GitHub Terms to Know

### Original Repository
This is the 'original cloud space' where I will upload all class materials and example code.

### Fork
'Forking' means making an exact 'copy' of the original repository to your personal GitHub account. You can then modify this copied repository however you like.

### Clone
'Cloning' means 'downloading' your forked repository to your own computer (where VS Code is installed). Now you can directly edit the code on your computer.

### Commit
When you modify and save code on your computer, 'recording' those changes to Git is called 'committing'.

### Push
'Pushing' means 'uploading' the changes you've committed to your GitHub online repository.

### Pull Request (PR)
A 'Pull Request (PR)' is when you 'request to merge' the changes you've uploaded to your online repository into the 'original repository' that I created. Through this process, I can review your code and provide feedback.

### Merge
This is the act of combining changes from one branch (or set of changes) into another. When your Pull Request is accepted, your changes are 'merged' into the original repository, combining your code with the main project code.
