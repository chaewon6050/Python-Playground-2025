## GitHub Terms to Know

### Repository
A space where project files and their change history are stored.
- **Local Repository:** Located on a personal computer.
- **Remote Repository:** Located on a server on the internet.

### Fork 
The process of completely copying another user's remote repository to your own remote repository. This allows you to modify or improve the project independently without directly affecting the original.

### Clone
The process of downloading a copy of a remote repository to your local computer (local repository). This allows you to work on all files and change history of the remote repository locally.

### Branch
A separate working space within a single project that allows multiple developers to work independently. The "master" or "main" branch typically serves as the base, and new branches are created for adding features, fixing bugs, etc.

### Staging
An intermediate step where modified files are collected before a commit. It's the area where you select and prepare the changes you intend to commit.

The act of recording the changes prepared in the staging area to the local repository. Each commit has unique information such as the content of the change, author, and date, and represents the project state at a specific point in time.

### Push
The process of uploading commits (changes) recorded in the local repository to the remote repository. This allows your local work to be shared with others.

### Merge
The process of combining changes from two or more branches into one. For example, a merge operation is ultimately performed when a pull request is approved.

### Pull Request (PR)
A feature that allows you to request that changes from your working branch be merged into another branch (usually the main branch). It's a core part of the collaboration process, enabling code review and discussion of proposed changes.
